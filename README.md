##### My Advice is to run colab in EC2 Free Tier Instance, It will loose a burden!
For Auto Disconnect Issue, Copy The Given Javascript in Colab And Paste in Your Tab Console And Never Close The Tab

##### And Before Reporting Any New Issue Related To Google Colab Please Try To Reset Runtime By Going To Runtime->Factory Reset Runtime
